#Finding a Shared Motif

# =============================================================================
# Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
# 
# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
# =============================================================================

#I think the best way to go about this will be to create a DFA for on string. 
#We then run the next sequence through the DFA to search for the largest substring.
#That substring becomes the new max substring. 
#We then run the subsequent strings through the DFA shortening the longest substring until we go through all the strings
#Whatever is left is the largest common substring 
#Scratch that idea, misread what I wanted to do.

#I think instead we should take the shortest string and then build a tree out of it with all possible strings 
#Suffix tree/trie 
#Example ATACA tree check notes. We can than 

#Making a trie in a slow way would be striaghtforward I think.
#We first insert the entire string into the trie. We then insert each substring so we do n insertions.
#The branching factor for the tree would be the size of the alphabet and it would grow pretty fast
#Once we have the first string inserted we insert subsequenct strings by following down the path of the tree. 
#If we hit a point where theres no branch to follow then we will insert the rest of the string letter by letter as children to that point
#Ex: Bananas
#first insertion is B - A - N - A -N - A - S
#Next we insert ANANAS. We start at the root node and search for an A connection. There is none so we add in a node to A and then the rest of the string
#then we insert NANAS. Same logic as ANANAS happens
#Then we insert ANAS. We search for the A and find it. This A is not eh node and we look for a child node of N which we find and then A then finally S which we dont so we create a new node. 

#Searching the node is taking a substring and then 

#ex: GATTACA, TAGACCA, ATACA 

#A --> T --> A --> C ---> A

#Now how do we make sure we get the largest subsequence 
#There is the idea where we all all strings into the trie with markers for which substrings belong to which string. 
#Find the deepest node that has all the following string terminators as children would be the largest substring
#That would require more work I will fix put an addition for that in the future. I would need to implement a way to read the tree from the leafs up. 

#This idea is slower but should work.
#We create a trie for 1 and then check the for all common substrings witht he search function
#We then create a trie of the next substring. We have a list of acceptable substrings from earlier and now we search all the strings in the list with search. Alot of wasted overlap
#Like if we find TACA ofc we will find ACA CA A C and this is gonna balloon fast.



#Been a while since I looked at this so lets try again from scratch
#We can do this in a simpler way 
#First find all the substrings of 1 string and search to see if those are in another
#Take the ones that made the cut and repeat with the next substrings
#This way we get all substrings for 1 string and just do repeated in which is how fast idk? O(n)?
