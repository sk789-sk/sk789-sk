#degree array 
#In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has, or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

#Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

#Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

#pretty much if the value shows up in the list then it has a neigher and an additional degree
#just run through the list once and make it so the value at the index increases by 1
#legit formatting is awful, just write to file everytime and upload file to keep it happy.
